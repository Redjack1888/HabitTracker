# HabitTracker
Habit Tracker (Project 9) for "Android Basics by Google Nanodegree Program" - (EU Scholarship) by Udacity

## Project Overview
This project is a chance for you to combine and practice everything you learned in this section of the Nanodegree program. You'll be setting up and using the database schema for a simple habit tracking app.

The goal is to design and create the structure of a Habit Tracking app which would allow a user to store and track their habits over time. This project will not have any UI components; instead, you will focus on what happens behind the scenes, practicing how to design and implement a simple database.

## What will I learn?
This project is about combining various ideas and skills weâ€™ve been practicing throughout the course. They include:

* Creating a SQLite table in your app
* Populating that table with new entries
* Modifying the entries
* Displaying the contents of the table to users.
